* use a descriptive word beginning with "S".

The project is MIT licensed.


Fetch code:
-----------
Given that you're reading this document there's a fair chance you've already
downloaded the code, but nevertheless, fetch it with Git here:
git clone git://github.com/canidae/saiph.git

Alternative mirror:
git clone http://projects.exent.net/saiph.git


Keeping your repo updated:
--------------------------
You should pull regularly with this command:
 git pull canidae master
Replace "canidae" if you used another name for that repo.


Building & running:
-------------------
If you are running on a public server, you will need to create a file named
".account" in the directory where you run saiph; it must have three lines,
consisting of the host name, the dgamelaunch user name, and the password,
like so:
nethack.alt.org
saiph
<password>

Furthermore, you will need to pass the -t option to saiph to run on a public
server.

Connecting to non-dgamelaunch-based servers, such as the ones that run the
/dev/null tournament, will not work. Patches welcome.

You'll also need a terminal that's capable of displaying at least 160x50
characters.

Then build & start the bot:
 mkdir build
 cd build
 cmake ..
 make
 ./saiph
